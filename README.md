# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description
This is a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns and play a classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe game, with the first player starting as "X" and the second player as "O".

## Features
- **Turn-based Gameplay**: Players take turns to place their symbols (X or O) on the grid.
- **Win Detection**: The game checks for a winning condition (three in a row) after each move.
- **Draw Detection**: If the grid is full and no player has won, the game declares a draw.
- **Play Again**: After a game is over, players can start a new game without refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Smooth Animations**: The game features smooth transitions and hover effects.

## Installation

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Game logic and interactivity.

## How to Play
1. The game starts with Player X.
2. Click on an empty box in the grid to place your symbol.
3. Players alternate turns until one player gets three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or the grid is full, resulting in a draw.
4. The game announces the winner or a draw, and players can click the "Play Again" button to start a new game.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a score counter to track the number of wins for each player.
- Implement a 5x5 version of the game as described in the project context.
- Add options for different player symbols and themes.
